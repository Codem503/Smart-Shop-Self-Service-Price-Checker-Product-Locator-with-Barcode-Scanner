# SmartShop
Shopping can often be time-consuming and frustrating, particularly when product prices or locations are difficult to find, or when staff assistance is limited. This project introduces a self-service system that integrates barcode scanning and a centralized database to help customers quickly access product prices and locations. Designed for user convenience, the system empowers shoppers to independently retrieve real-time information while reducing reliance on store staff.
