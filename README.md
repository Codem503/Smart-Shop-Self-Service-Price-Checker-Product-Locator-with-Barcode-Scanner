# SmartShop
OBJECTIVE
Shopping can often be time-consuming and frustrating, particularly when product prices or locations are difficult to find, or when staff assistance is limited. This project introduces a self-service system that integrates barcode scanning and a centralized database to help customers quickly access product prices and locations. Designed for user convenience, the system empowers shoppers to independently retrieve real-time information while reducing reliance on store staff.

**HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN IT**
To convert a .jar file into an executable .exe file, first locate the Copy_OpenCV_config1.jar in the dist folder. Then, use Install Creator Pro to create an installer. Install the program, open it, and add the .jar file. Optionally, bundle a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) if needed. Configure the installer settings, then build it to generate the .exe file. Once created, test the .exe to ensure it works, and distribute it for easy execution without needing a .jar file.
